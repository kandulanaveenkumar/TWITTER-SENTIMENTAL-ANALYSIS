# TWITTER-SENTIMENTAL-ANALYSIS
THIS IS MY FIRST PYTHON PROJECT

#INTRODUCTION

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a hotbed of research in data science these days and one of the most common applications of NLP is sentiment analysis. From opinion polls to creating entire marketing strategies, this domain has completely reshaped the way businesses work, which is why this is an area every data scientist must be familiar with.

Here in this project we have used some python modules like textblob for text manupilation , extracting parts of speech tagging and tweepy to connect to twitter api
